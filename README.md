odin-book project

## This is my attempt at [The Odin Project's Odin-book](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-nodejs-odin-book). 

--- 

The gist of the project is to implement a simple version of a popular social media website, with Facebook, X, Myspace, or Threads being listed as examples. However, my attempt will be [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/), a popular photo sharing app.
